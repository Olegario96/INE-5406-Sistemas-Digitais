# INE-5406-Sistemas-Digitais
Repository with a MIPS Multicycle in VHDL. Unfortanelly, was not able to finish the MIPS, because the memory file is really hard
to deal with. Also, the memory file was take from the internet. All the others files are made by myself and they are working, 
according to the Quartus synthetization. The MIPS follows the Patterson model from Computer Organization and Design without
pipelines.
